# Dependency Constants and Compiler Directives

## Compiler Directives

Compiler directives are a way to compile code only if a specific condition is met. To
use this you have the `#if`, `#endif`, `#else` and `#elseif` keyword.

Contditons you can check for are

- `SERVER` Checks if the code is compiled on the server VM.
- `CLIENT` Checks if the code is compiled on the client VM.
- `UI` Checks if the code is compiled on the UI VM.
- `MP` Checks if the code is compiled in a multiplayer match.
- `SP` Checks if the code is compiled in a singeplayer match.
- `DEV` Checks if the code is compiled with the `-dev` keyword in the startup
    arguments.

These conditions can also be combined with the regular squirrel boolean expressions

```squirrel
#if SERVER
Chat_ServerBroadcast("Message from the server VM")
#endif
```

```squirrel
#if (CLIENT && MP) || DEV
...
#elseif SP
...
#endif
```

## Dependency Constants

Dependency constants are used to only compile code if a dependency your mod requires is
loaded, these use the Compiler directives syntax.

Inside your `mod.json` define a constant as:

```squirrel
{
    // mod.json stuff
    "Dependencies": {
        // sets the constant to 0 or 1, depending if the mod with the name "Mod Name" exists and is enabled
        "CONSTANT_NAME": "Mod Name"
    }
}
```

For Example:

```json
"PLAYER_HAS_ROGUELIKE_MOD": "TF|Roguelike"
```

Will define a constant `PLAYER_HAS_ROGUELIKE_MOD` that is set to `0` or `1`
depending if the mod is enabled. It then can be used as a constant/compiler flag.

```squirrel
#if PLAYER_HAS_ROGUELIKE_MOD
print("player has roguelike mod")
Roguelike_Function();
#else
print("Can't use the function because the mod is off :'(")
#endif
```
