# Client Commands

Client commands are how the clients communicate with the server. Mods can define custom Client Commands that people can then use from the console, or that can be called from a clientside script.

!!! cpp-function "void AddClientCommandCallback(string, void functionref(entity, array<string> ))"

    Registers a function as a callback for a client command. This can only be done once per client command string.

    ```squirrel
    AddClientCommandCallback("commandname", commandcallback)

    void CommandCalled(entity player, array<string> args) {
        print("commandname: was called with " + args);
    }
    ```
