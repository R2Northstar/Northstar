# Element Notation


Elements are notated as [VDF](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/KeyValues)

UI elements are created when a menu is initialized. References to the elements will stay the same, regardless if the menu is open or not.

It is not possible to create elements at runtime so you have to define all elements a menu or panel contains beforehand in appropriate files.

An Element is declared in the following way:

```
// please follow this structure
ElementName
{
    ControlName name
    // optional: classname, inheritance, ids ...

    // optional: other properties

    // optional: pinning
}
```

If you're working on a **menu**, you need a `menu` object that contains all elements, for example like this:

```
resource/ui/menus/profiles_menu.menu
{
    menu
    {
        ControlName Frame
        xpos 0
        ypos 0
        zpos 3
        wide f0
        tall f0
        autoResize 0
        visible 1
        enabled 1
        pinCorner 0
        PaintBackgroundType 0
        infocus_bgcolor_override "0 0 0 0"
        outoffocus_bgcolor_override "0 0 0 0"

        // elements
    }
}
```
It usually doesn't matter if you use quotation marks to assign string values to parameters.

## HUD & Panel files

The first line of a `.menu` or `.res` file needs to be the resource path to itself, starting from the resource folder.

It's not possible to load other files as menus or panels. A `.menu` represents an independant menu of the game, while `.res` files are "Panels" that can be loaded from other elements.

The rest of the file needs to be wrapped in curly brackets.

```
resource/ui/menus/more/folders/my_menu.menu
{
    MyObject
    {
        // object properties go here
    }

    // more objects ...
}
```

### Properties

Capitalization of the properties shouldn't matter.

!!! cpp-function "(ElementName)"

    This isn't a regular property and comes **before** the opening bracket

    Unique string identifier used in scripts to look up an element. Every element is required to have a name.

#### Inheritance / Parenting

!!! cpp-function "ControlName"

    Controls what type of Component the element is and what parameters have an effect. Every element is required to have control name.

!!! cpp-function "InheritProperties"

!!! cpp-function "controlSettingsFile"

    Load a `.res` file. All elements in the settings file are instantiated and set as children of the element.

    `Hud_GetChild` only works if the parent element is (has the `ControlName`) a **CNestedPanel**!

#### Identifying

### Conditional Properties

You can declare properties for specific conditions by adding `[CONDITION]` after the property value.

When putting a condition after an element's name, the element will only be created if the condition evaluates to true.

Usable conditions are:

!!! cpp-function "$WIN32"

    game is running on 32 bit windows

!!! cpp-function "$WINDOWS"

    game is running on windows

!!! cpp-function "$DURANGO"

    game is running on xbox

!!! cpp-function "$PS4"

    game is running on a PS4

!!! cpp-function "$GAMECONSOLE"

!!! cpp-function "$WIDESCREEN_16_9"

    game resolution is 16/9

!!! cpp-function "$LANGUAGE"

    the game's language.

    ```text
    // use allcaps only in russian
    allCaps        0  [!$RUSSIAN]
    allCaps        1  [$RUSSIAN]
    ```



On top of that, logical operators like `!`, `&&` and `||` are available as well.

#### Example:

```text
// This element only shows on pc
IngameTextChat [$WINDOWS]
{
    ControlName             CBaseHudChat

    visible                 0

    pin_to_sibling          Screen
    pin_corner_to_sibling   TOP_LEFT
    pin_to_sibling_corner   TOP_LEFT
    xpos                    -45
    ypos                    -616
}

// This element has different widths depending on the game resolution
LoadingTip
{
    ControlName             Label
    ypos                    10

    pin_to_sibling          LoadingGameMode
    pin_corner_to_sibling   TOP_LEFT
    pin_to_sibling_corner   BOTTOM_LEFT
}

```

### Pinning

!!! cpp-function "CENTER"

    The calculated center of the element

!!! cpp-function "TOP"

    Element's top y bounds, x axis center.

!!! cpp-function "BOTTOM"

    Element's lowest y bounds, x axis center.

!!! cpp-function "LEFT"

### Units

You can calculate the position or dimensions etc. with different units. If you provide no extra unit, the game uses pixels.

!!! cpp-function "%x"

    x percent of the screen.

    ```
    // cover the entire screen
    width   %100
    height  %100
    ```

!!! cpp-function "fx"

    use 100%

!!! cpp-function "c+/-x"

    something with the screen edges not exactly sure how positions get calculated

### Including KeyValues

To include another KeyValue file, use `#base "filepath"` at the top of a VDF file.
