# Plugins

!!! note

    Writing plugins require some very basic familiarity with C++


Plugins are native modules loaded by Northstar. Because they're not limited to any API provided by the game, plugins are a powerful tool to enable you to do almost anything you could with a custom Northstar Client.

For example, you could write a plugin that [compiles maps](https://github.com/catornot/furnace) at runtime, allows squirrel scripts to save and load recorded animations [from disk](https://github.com/uniboi/recanim) or provide [discord rpc](https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarDiscordRPC) integration.

However because plugins have full access to your system plugins should be treated with caution and regular scripts are preferred if possible.

## Installation

Any `.dll` file located in the directories `<Northstar Profile>/plugins/` and `<Northstar Profile>/packages/<Thunderstore package>/plugins/` will be attempted to load as a plugin.

To manually install a plugin, copy the plugin `.dll` into the `<Northstar Profile>/plugins/` directory.

!!! note

    The default northstar profile name is `R2Northstar`. Profiles are located in the same location as `NorthstarLauncher.exe`.


Any Plugin is only valid if it exposes every required [interface](interfaces.md).

If a plugin does not expose every Interface the Launcher requires, it is unloaded immediately.

### Valid plugins

Every plugin must fulfill these criteria to be considered valid by Northstar.

Invalid plugins get unloaded as soon as possible.

- The plugin module must export a function named [`CreateInterface`](interfaces.md/#createinterface) that returns an interface instance when called.

- Every [required interface](required-interfaces.md) must be exposed via `CreateInterface`

### Debugging

If you know how to use a debugger you can safely skip this.

For simplicity it's assumed your development environment is Visual Studio and you're compiling Northstar from source.

Otherwise are the steps basically the same everywhere else.

1. Clone the [Launcher](https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarLauncher)

2. Set the binary output directory to the location wherever you have installed your game. The compiled `NorthstarLauncher.exe` should be outputted next to `Titanfall.exe`.

3. Launch `NorthstarLauncher.exe` with a debugger or attach a debugger to a running process

4. Place the plugin PDB (for example `myplugin.pdb` next to the plugin's DLL.

That's it.

### Hooks

Any Plugin can install hooks independently from another. Before installing a hook, verify that the target address has not been modified.

In the case that the target has already been modified by another plugin, do not overwrite the trampoline. Overwriting another plugin's hook will result in crashes and unexpected behaviour.

There exists no shared interface for hooks. Plugins that need to install hooks will have to bundle a library for this purpose.
